 · Proposed IR-based code generator to systematically bridge the gap between programming interface and kernel APIs, and decouples models, data layout, kernel-specific optimization from each other
 · Achieves up to 7.8× speed-up in inference and 5.6× speed-up in training compared with public state-of-the-art system in RGCN, RGAT, HGT
 · Proposed one inter-operator optimization and two intermediate data layout options to further accelerate the system to deliver up to 2.2× speed up
